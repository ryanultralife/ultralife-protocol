# Put Your Life Online

## The Bottom-Up Economy

UltraLife isn't waiting for institutions. It starts with **you** — your skills, your products, your land, your time. Every person can become an economic node, offering what they have and finding what they need.

## What Can You List?

### Your Skills (Work)

```
"I can fix cars"
"I teach piano"
"I speak three languages"
"I know this forest"
"I care for elderly people"
"I write code"
"I grow food"
```

Every skill you have is an offering waiting to happen.

### Your Products (Things)

```
"Eggs from my chickens"
"Furniture I build"
"Bread I bake"
"Art I create"
"Clothes I sew"
"Honey from my bees"
"Vegetables from my garden"
```

What you make with your hands has value.

### Your Land Rights (Resources)

If you have land, you have separable rights:

| Right | What It Means | Example Listing |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Surface** | Use of the ground | "Grazing rights, 40 acres, $X/month" |
| **Subsurface** | Minerals below | "Gravel extraction rights, 5 acres" |
| **Water** | Streams, wells, rain | "Spring water access, 1000 gal/month" |
| **Air** | Emissions, capture | "Carbon capture credits from my forest" |
| **Cellulose** | Living biomass | "Timber rights, sustainable harvest" |
| **Carbon** | Sequestration | "Verified carbon in my soil, X tons" |
| **Development** | Building rights | "Cabin site, 1 acre, utilities available" |
| **Access** | Passage rights | "Trail access through property" |

You don't have to sell your land. You can lease individual rights while keeping ownership.

### Your Space (Access)

```
"Park in my driveway"
"Use my workshop"
"Camp on my land"
"Store in my barn"
"Dock at my pier"
```

### Your Knowledge (Information)

```
"I know the old trails"
"I know which plants are edible"
"I know how this machine works"
"I know the history of this place"
"I know traditional fishing spots"
```

Traditional ecological knowledge. Local expertise. Lived experience.

### Your Care (Time)

```
"I can watch your kids"
"I can check on your parents"
"I can walk your dog"
"I can sit with someone who's lonely"
"I can help someone learn to read"
```

Care work has always been valuable. Now it's tracked and credited.

## How To List Anything

### Talk to Any LLM

```
You: "I want to offer piano lessons"

LLM: Great! Let me help you create that offering.

     What's your rate? (or negotiable?)
You: "$30/hour but I'll negotiate for neighbors"

LLM: Where can you teach?
You: "My home in Sierra Nevada, or I can travel within 20 miles"

LLM: How often are you available?
You: "Weekday evenings and Saturday mornings"

LLM: Here's your offering:

     Sign to publish?
```

That's it. Your skill is now discoverable by anyone in your bioregion.

### List Your Land Rights

```
You: "I have 80 acres with a creek. What can I list?"

LLM: Let me help you understand your separable rights:

     Your 80 acres could offer:
     
     💧 WATER RIGHTS
     ├── Creek: Seasonal flow, ~X gallons
     ├── Groundwater: Unknown (survey available)
     └── Rain capture: ~X gallons/year potential
     
     🌲 CELLULOSE RIGHTS  
     ├── Standing timber: ~X board feet (estimate)
     ├── Sustainable harvest: X/year without depletion
     └── Firewood: ~X cords/year
     
     🌍 CARBON RIGHTS
     ├── Current sequestration: Unknown (survey available)
     ├── Improvement potential: Depends on management
     └── Verification: Requires surveyor
     
     🏕️ ACCESS RIGHTS
     ├── Camping: How many sites?
     ├── Trails: Existing paths?
     └── Hunting/fishing: Allowed?
     
     ⛏️ SUBSURFACE RIGHTS
     ├── Minerals: Unknown (geological survey available)
     ├── Gravel/sand: Visible deposits?
     └── Geothermal: Unknown
     
     Which would you like to list first?

You: "Let's start with camping access"

LLM: Creating access offering:
     
     🏕️ Camping on 80-Acre Creek Property
     ├── Sites: How many can you host at once?
You: "3 sites, spread out for privacy"
     
     ├── Amenities: What's available?
You: "Creek access, fire pits, outhouse, no electricity"
     
     ├── Rate: Per night?
You: "$25/night or work trade"
     
     ├── Rules?

     Sign to publish?
```

### List Your Minerals

```
You: "I think I have gravel deposits. How do I list extraction rights?"

LLM: For mineral rights, we need some information:

     1. VERIFICATION
        Do you have a geological survey?
        
You: "No, just visible gravel beds in the creek area"

LLM: You have two options:
     
     A) List as "unverified" - lower price, buyer does survey
     B) Get surveyed first - costs X, verified = higher price
     
     Want me to find surveyors in your bioregion?
     
You: "List as unverified for now"

LLM: Creating mineral offering:
     
     ⛏️ Gravel Extraction Rights (Unverified)
     ├── Location: Creek bed area, ~2 acres
     ├── Quantity: Unknown (visible deposits)
     ├── Terms: Lease or purchase?
You: "Lease, 5 year term"
     ├── Rate: Negotiable or set price?
You: "I don't know what's fair"

LLM: Comparable listings in your bioregion:
     - Verified gravel: $X/cubic yard
     - Unverified typically: 50-70% of verified rate
     - Lease vs purchase: Lease usually X/year + royalty
     
     Suggestion: $X/year base + 10% royalty per cubic yard
     
You: "That sounds reasonable"

LLM: Here's your offering:
     
     ⛏️ Gravel Rights - Creek Bed (Unverified)
     ├── Area: ~2 acres
     ├── Term: 5-year lease
     ├── Rate: $X/year + 10% royalty
     ├── Status: Unverified (buyer surveys)
     └── Impact: Buyer must post remediation bond
     
     Note: Any extraction requires remediation plan.
     The buyer posts a bond before work begins.

## The Impact Is Automatic

Every listing automatically calculates expected impact:

```
🥚 Farm Fresh Eggs (1 dozen)
├── Price: 8 tokens
└── Impact flows:
    ├── Carbon: +0.2 (local, no transport)
    ├── Water: -2.1 (chicken water usage)
    ├── Biodiversity: +0.5 (pasture-raised)
    └── Net: -1.4 (you see this on your pNFT)
```

Buyers see the impact before purchasing. Your low-impact products are visible.

---

## Finding What You Need

It works both ways. List what you need:

```
You: "I need someone to help me clear brush this weekend"

LLM: Creating a need listing:
     
     🔨 NEED: Brush Clearing Help
     ├── When: This Saturday, 8am-2pm
     ├── Where: Your property
     ├── Pay: What's your budget?
You: "$20/hour or trade"
     ├── Trade for: What can you offer?
You: "Eggs, firewood, or future help"

LLM: Here's your need:
     
     🔨 Brush Clearing Help Needed
     ├── When: Saturday 8am-2pm (6 hours max)
     ├── Pay: $20/hr OR trade (eggs/firewood/labor)
     ├── Location: [Your property]
     └── Physical: Moderate difficulty
     
     Matching workers in your area:
     - Maria (4.8⭐, 2 miles away, available Sat)
     - Jake (4.5⭐, 5 miles away, interested in firewood)
     
     Send to both?
```

## Economic Loops Form Naturally

```
Rosa's eggs → Marcus buys for weekend cabin trips
Marcus's timber → Local mill processes → Rosa buys lumber
Rosa's carpentry → Fixes June's porch
June's knowledge → Teaches Alex about plants
Alex's tech help → Sets up Marcus's security cameras
```

Money circulates locally. Skills find needs. Resources find uses.

## Your Subsurface Rights

Most people don't realize what's under their land:

### Minerals
- Gravel, sand, clay (construction)
- Metals (if any deposits)
- Stone (building, landscaping)

### Water
- Aquifer access
- Well drilling rights
- Geothermal potential

### Space
- Underground storage
- Root cellars
- Bunker rights (yes, really)

```
You: "How do I know what minerals I have?"

LLM: Options in your bioregion:

     1. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY
        - Professional assessment: ~$500-2000
        - Identifies deposits, estimates quantity
        - Required for verified listings
        
     2. HISTORICAL RECORDS
        - County mining history: Free
        - Previous surveys on file: Free
        - Neighbor's findings: Ask
        
     3. SATELLITE DATA
        - Spectral analysis services: ~$100
        - Shows surface indicators
        - Not definitive but cheap
        
     4. LIST UNVERIFIED
        - Lower price
        - Buyer assumes survey cost
        - Faster to market
        
     Which approach interests you?
```

```
You: "I have a lot of mushrooms in my forest"

LLM: Mushroom rights can be listed as:

     1. HARVEST RIGHTS
        - You let others forage
        - Rate per pound or per day
        - You set limits and rules

## Carbon On Your Land

If you have trees, soil, or wetlands, you have carbon:

```
You: "Can I sell carbon credits from my 40 acres of forest?"

LLM: Yes! Here's how it works:

     1. BASELINE SURVEY
        - Measure current carbon stored
        - Costs: ~$500-1500 for 40 acres
        - Done by certified surveyors
        
     2. MANAGEMENT PLAN
        - Commit to maintaining/increasing
        - 10-50 year terms typical
        - Restrictions on harvesting
        
     3. ANNUAL VERIFICATION
        - Surveyor confirms compliance
        - New carbon measured
        - Credits issued
        
     4. SELL CREDITS
        - On impact market
        - Buyers: Anyone with carbon debt
        - Price: Market rate (~$X/ton currently)
        
     Your 40 acres of forest stores approximately:
     - Existing: ~200-400 tons (estimate)
     - Annual sequestration: ~2-4 tons/year
     
     At current prices: ~$X/year in credit sales
     
     Want me to find surveyors in your bioregion?
```

## FAQ

**Q: What if I don't have land?**
A: Your skills and time are valuable. That's where most people start.

**Q: What if my offerings don't sell?**
A: Adjust pricing, improve descriptions, or look for what's needed in your bioregion and build toward that.

**Q: What about liability?**
A: Agreements include terms. Disputes are rare when everything is transparent and traceable to pNFTs.

**Q: Can I list things for free?**
A: Yes. Community service earns care credits, which factor into your UBI.

**Q: What if I'm not good at describing things?**
A: The LLM helps you. Just talk naturally.

**Q: What about seasonal offerings?**
A: List with availability windows. Pause and unpause as needed.

**Q: Can I list for someone else?**
A: You can help them, but offerings must come from their pNFT. No intermediaries extracting value.
