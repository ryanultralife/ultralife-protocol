# What UltraLife Does

**Management Software for Life on Earth**

---

## One Sentence

UltraLife is a blockchain system where every human has one permanent identity, every transaction tracks its environmental impact, and communities organize around ecological boundaries instead of political ones.

---

## The Bar for Participation

**Can you talk?**

That's it. No apps to download. No interfaces to learn. You talk to any LLM (Claude, GPT, Llama, your local model), and it handles everything else.

```
You: "I want to offer my carpentry services"

LLM: I'll create that offering for you. Here's a transaction to review:
     - Service: Carpentry work
     - Location: Sierra Nevada bioregion
     - Rate: 50 tokens/hour
     - Expected impact: +12 (local materials, low carbon)
     
     Sign in your wallet to publish this offering.
```

---

## What Makes It Different

### 1. One Identity Per Human

Every person has ONE pNFT (Personal NFT), verified by DNA. You can't create fake accounts. You can't abandon a bad reputation. Your identity is permanent, just like you are.

```
Traditional: Multiple wallets, multiple identities, sybil attacks
UltraLife:   One person = one pNFT = one accountability trail
```

### 2. Everything Has Impact

No transaction is neutral. When you buy coffee, that coffee has a supply chain with carbon emissions, water usage, and labor involved. UltraLife tracks all of it.

```
Buy coffee → Your pNFT accrues:
  - 0.3 kg CO₂ (roasting, transport)
  - 140 L virtual water (farming)
  - +2 care credits (fair trade labor)
```

The consumer accrues the impact. Your demand drives the chain.

### 3. Bioregions Not Borders

Everything is organized by ecological boundaries (watersheds, forests, ecosystems) rather than political lines. Your UBI comes from the health of your bioregion, not your nation.

```
867 bioregions worldwide, based on WWF ecoregions
Each with: health index, treasury, governance, UBI distribution
```

### 4. Spending Buckets

Pre-allocate your money into buckets with automatic budgeting:

```
┌─────────────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐ ┌─────────────────┐
│ Daily Spending  │ │ Monthly Bills   │ │ Emergency Fund  │
│ 50 tokens/day   │ │ 500 tokens/mo   │ │ grows over time │
│ rollover: yes   │ │ rollover: no    │ │ min: 1000       │
└─────────────────┘ └─────────────────┘ └─────────────────┘
```

Operates in Hydra (instant, feeless). Settles to L1 in batches.

### 5. Collectives Not Corporations

Businesses are just groups of pNFTs with shared resources:

```
Collective = pNFTs + Land + Equipment + Treasury + Governance
```

Transparent. No shell companies. Every member accountable.

### 6. Validators Earn ULTRA (Not ADA)

Stake ULTRA tokens. Earn ULTRA fees. The protocol absorbs ADA fees so participants never touch ADA if they don't want to.

## How It Works

### For Regular People

1. **Get your pNFT** — Visit a DNA verification partner (or use simpler verification tiers)
2. **Receive 50 tokens** — Bootstrap grant upon verification
3. **Talk to any LLM** — That's your interface
4. **Create offerings** — Offer goods, services, knowledge, care
5. **Accept offerings** — Buy what you need
6. **Track your impact** — See your environmental footprint
7. **Receive UBI** — Based on bioregion health and your participation

### For Businesses

1. **Create a collective** — Group of pNFTs
2. **Register resources** — Equipment, land, vehicles
3. **Create offerings** — Your products and services
4. **All transactions tracked** — Transparent accounting
5. **Impact flows automatically** — No separate sustainability reporting

### For Validators (SPOs)

1. **Stake ULTRA** — Minimum 100,000 tokens
2. **Serve a bioregion** — Local validation
3. **Earn ULTRA fees** — From protocol activity
4. **Run Hydra heads** — Local instant transactions
5. **No ADA needed** — Fee pool covers L1 costs

## The Economic Loop

```
ACTION → IMPACT → RECORD → BIOREGION HEALTH → UBI
   ↑                                              │
   └──────────────── DISTRIBUTION ◄───────────────┘

EXTRACTION → MUST REMEDIATE → REGENERATORS GET PAID
                                      │
                                      ▼
                              ECOSYSTEM IMPROVES
                                      │
                                      ▼
                              UBI INCREASES FOR ALL
```

### MCP Service

LLMs connect to UltraLife through MCP (Model Context Protocol):

- **31 tools** for reading chain state and building transactions
- **Embedded context** so LLMs can explain the protocol
- **No private keys** — LLM builds, wallet signs, chain validates

### Cardano Integration

- **Reference scripts** — All validators deployed on-chain
- **Blockfrost/Ogmios/Koios** — Standard API access
- **Lucid/Blaze/Mesh** — Transaction building
- **Hydra** — L2 for instant local transactions
- **Leios** — Future L1 throughput (10,000+ TPS)
- **Starstream** — Future privacy layer

## Next: Put Your Life Online

You have skills. Products. Maybe land. Time. Knowledge.

**→ [PUT_YOUR_LIFE_ONLINE.md](PUT_YOUR_LIFE_ONLINE.md)** shows you how to list:

- Your skills (work you can do)
- Your products (things you make)
- Your land rights (surface, water, minerals, carbon, timber)
- Your space (access you can offer)
- Your knowledge (what you know)
- Your care (time you can give)

The economy grows from the bottom up. From you.
